## Assets Comparison

<h3> A simple app</h3>
<h4> CX </h4>


--- 
## What the app does

1. Plot a single asset from a specific sorce in a specific date range
2. Plot two assets together if their price range are close
3. Plot two assets separately if their price range are far from each other

--- .class #id 

## How it is done

1. Using <quantmod> package to fetch the data
2. Using chartSeries function to plot the data

--- .class #id

## Problem and future development

1. At this point, only 'yahoo' source works, ther sources cause problem when app is deployed, though they work find locally
2. More features such as log scale plot, technical indicators, can be added later

--- .class #id

## An example
Assets: SPY, IBM
```{r}
library(quantmod)
p1 <- getSymbols('SPY', auto.assign = FALSE)
p2 <- getSymbols('IBM', auto.assign = FALSE)
chartSeries(as.xts(merge(p1, p2)))
```
